 - In the solution notes for the first supervision, what is the idea of the proof for inversion for ->, is it we assume that the lhs of the implication
 is true and then that means that there is a transition so we look at the rules that could provide a transition and then we split the rules up into
 cases? If that is the main idea why does the proof have "or..." and "then either ... or blah or ...", wouldn't splitting into cases have the or "built-in",
 as in the transition must be one of the following cases.

 - In the notes the proof of determinacy has the cases for "e_1 op e_2", how do we justify that the op symbol has to be the same for (op+) or (op>=)
 cases? I can intuitively see why we can't have first case being "e_1 + e_2" and the second being "e_1 >= e_2" but how is this formally shown. 
 (The notes just say by examining the expressions in the left-hand-sides of the conclusions of the rules, and the irreducibility of values
 lemma, the only possibilities are these)
