# Some-IB-Notes
Some course notes written in LaTeX, written by me based on the lecture notes provided by the courses (2024-2025)


N.B. The preamble looks disgusting in retrospect, the notes were created w.r.t. this preamble so changing the paper geometry (although recommended) will lead to weird gaps and jumps which you would need to fix. (If you do change the look, add a request and I will give a quick look and probally accept it, same with any mistakes).

My new notes use:
```
\geometry{
  paper=a4paper,
  inner=33.4125mm,
  outer=33.4125mm,
  top=37.125mm,
  bottom=37.125mm,
  heightrounded,
  marginparwidth=51pt,
  marginparsep=17pt,
  headsep=24pt,
}
```

Although, these notes can be used by anyone I would also advise you to make your own notes. People often say that spending the time to write notes is wasted (especially in LaTeX how I did it), I disagree going through the slides slowly and writing the notes out in detail helped the content stick for me and I could recall writing it when a question was asked. Obviously, this does take a lot of time but find what works for you.
